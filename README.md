# 🌊 Dam Water Level Monitoring System using Ultrasonic Sensor

An automated **Dam Water Level Monitoring System** built using an **Arduino Uno** and an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to continuously monitor water levels and provide real-time alerts during warning and danger conditions.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To design and implement a non-contact water level monitoring system for dams that improves safety through early flood warning alerts.

---

## ✅ Objectives
- Monitor water level without physical contact
- Display real-time distance and status on an LCD
- Provide visual alerts using LEDs
- Generate audible alerts for warning and danger levels
- Enhance dam safety and early warning mechanisms

---

## 🧩 Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- I2C LCD Display (16×2)  
- Green, Yellow, Red LEDs  
- Buzzer  
- 330Ω Resistors  
- Connecting Wires  
- Power Supply  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves toward the water surface. The reflected echo is received by the sensor, and the time taken is converted into distance using the speed of sound. Based on predefined threshold values, the system determines the water level condition and triggers alerts accordingly.

## 🔄 System Operation

| Condition | Distance | Indication |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Safe | > 20 cm | Green LED ON, Buzzer OFF |
| Warning | 10–20 cm | Yellow LED ON, Buzzer for 3 seconds |
| Danger | ≤ 10 cm | Red LED ON, Continuous Buzzer |
